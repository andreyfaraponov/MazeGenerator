# Room Modifier - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Room Modifier adds rectangular open spaces (rooms) to mazes, creating dungeon-style layouts with chambers connected by corridors. This is perfect for RPG dungeons, roguelike games, and exploration scenarios.

---

## Features

✅ **Configurable Room Count** - Control how many rooms to add  
✅ **Variable Room Sizes** - Set minimum and maximum room dimensions  
✅ **Smart Placement** - Automatically avoids overlapping rooms  
✅ **Guaranteed Connection** - Rooms are always connected to the maze  
✅ **Reproducible** - Use seeds for consistent layouts  
✅ **Dungeon-Style** - Creates authentic dungeon atmosphere

## Basic Usage

### Simple Room Maze
```csharp
using MazeGenerator;

// Create maze with default room settings (5 rooms, 3-7 size)
var maze = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30);
```

### Custom Room Configuration
```csharp
var maze = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    width: 40,
    height: 40,
    roomCount: 8,
    minRoomSize: 4,
    maxRoomSize: 10
);
```

### With Seed for Reproducibility
```csharp
var maze = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    width: 30,
    height: 30,
    roomCount: 6,
    seed: 42
);
```

### Using Configuration Object
```csharp
var config = new MazeConfiguration
{
    Width = 35,
    Height = 35,
    Type = MazeType.WithRooms,
    RoomCount = 7,
    MinRoomSize = 3,
    MaxRoomSize = 8,
    Algorithm = MazeAlgorithmType.RecursiveBacktracker,
    Seed = 12345
};

var maze = MazeFactory.Create(config);
```

---

## Configuration Parameters

### RoomCount (Default: 5)
Number of rooms to attempt to place in the maze.

```csharp
// Few rooms - mostly corridors
var sparse = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, roomCount: 3);

// Medium rooms - balanced
var balanced = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, roomCount: 6);

// Many rooms - dungeon-heavy
var dense = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, roomCount: 10);
```

**Recommended values:**
- Small mazes (20×20): 3-5 rooms
- Medium mazes (30×30): 5-8 rooms
- Large mazes (50×50): 8-15 rooms

### MinRoomSize (Default: 3)
Minimum width and height for rooms.

```csharp
// Tiny rooms (2×2 minimum)
var tiny = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, minRoomSize: 2);

// Small rooms (3×3 minimum)
var small = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, minRoomSize: 3);

// Large rooms (5×5 minimum)
var large = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, minRoomSize: 5);
```

**Guidelines:**
- Minimum value: 2
- Must be less than MaxRoomSize
- Recommended: 3-5 for most mazes

### MaxRoomSize (Default: 7)
Maximum width and height for rooms.

```csharp
// Small rooms only (max 5×5)
var small = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, maxRoomSize: 5);

// Medium variety (max 8×8)
var medium = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, maxRoomSize: 8);

// Large chambers (max 12×12)
var large = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, maxRoomSize: 12);
```

**Guidelines:**
- Must be greater than MinRoomSize
- Recommended: 7-10 for 30×30 mazes
- Scale with maze size (larger mazes = larger max)

## Examples

### Example 1: Small Dungeon
```csharp
// 20×20 maze with small rooms
var dungeon = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
    roomCount: 4,
    minRoomSize: 3,
    maxRoomSize: 5
);
```

### Example 2: Large Dungeon Complex
```csharp
// 50×50 maze with varied room sizes
var complex = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    roomCount: 12,
    minRoomSize: 4,
    maxRoomSize: 10,
    seed: 42
);
```

### Example 3: Boss Room Dungeon
```csharp
// Smaller rooms except for one large "boss room"
var config = new MazeConfiguration
{
    Width = 40,
    Height = 40,
    Type = MazeType.WithRooms,
    RoomCount = 8,
    MinRoomSize = 3,
    MaxRoomSize = 8
};

var maze = MazeFactory.Create(config);
```

### Example 4: Progressive Difficulty
```csharp
public Maze GenerateDungeonForLevel(int level)
{
    // More rooms and larger spaces as player progresses
    int roomCount = 3 + (level / 2);
    int maxSize = Math.Min(5 + level, 12);
    
    return MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
        width: 25 + level * 2,
        height: 25 + level * 2,
        roomCount: roomCount,
        minRoomSize: 3,
        maxRoomSize: maxSize
    );
}
```

### Example 5: Render and Save
```csharp
using MazeGenerator.Rendering;
using System.IO;

var dungeon = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30, roomCount: 6);

// ASCII rendering
var asciiRenderer = new AsciiRenderer();
Console.WriteLine(asciiRenderer.RenderUnicode(dungeon));

// SVG rendering
var svgRenderer = new SvgRenderer();
File.WriteAllText("dungeon.svg", svgRenderer.Render(dungeon));
```

### Example 6: Different Algorithms
```csharp
// Room modifier works with any generation algorithm

// Eller's (default)
var eller = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30);

// Recursive Backtracker - long corridors
var config1 = new MazeConfiguration
{
    Width = 30, Height = 30,
    Algorithm = MazeAlgorithmType.RecursiveBacktracker,
    Type = MazeType.WithRooms,
    RoomCount = 6
};
var backtracker = new Maze(config1);

// Recursive Division - natural chambers
var config2 = new MazeConfiguration
{
    Width = 30, Height = 30,
    Algorithm = MazeAlgorithmType.RecursiveDivision,
    Type = MazeType.WithRooms,
    RoomCount = 5
};
var division = new Maze(config2);
```

## How It Works

### 1. Room Generation
- Random width and height within min/max bounds
- Random position ensuring room fits in maze

### 2. Overlap Detection
- Checks against existing rooms
- Maintains 1-cell buffer between rooms
- Retries if overlap detected

### 3. Room Carving
- Removes all internal walls within room
- Creates open rectangular space
- Preserves room perimeter initially

### 4. Connection
- Picks random side of room
- Opens passage to adjacent corridor
- Ensures room is accessible

### 5. Iteration
- Attempts placement up to 50 times per desired room
- Stops when room count reached or max attempts exhausted

## Use Cases

### RPG Dungeons
```csharp
var dungeon = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(40, 40, roomCount: 8);
// Rooms can be encounter areas, treasure rooms, etc.
```

### Roguelike Games
```csharp
// Different room counts for variety
var level = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    35, 35, 
    roomCount: Random.Range(5, 10),
    seed: GenerateSeed()
);
```

### Procedural Dungeons
```csharp
// Use seed for reproducible dungeons
var dungeon = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
    30, 30, 
    roomCount: 6,
    seed: worldSeed + levelNumber
);
```

### Multi-Floor Complexes
```csharp
for (int floor = 1; floor <= 5; floor++)
{
    var maze = MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
        30, 30,
        roomCount: 3 + floor,
        minRoomSize: 3,
        maxRoomSize: 5 + floor,
        seed: baseSeed + floor
    );
    
    SaveFloor(floor, maze);
}
```

## Best Practices

### Room Sizing
✅ **Match maze size** - Larger mazes support larger rooms  
✅ **Leave space** - Don't fill entire maze with rooms  
✅ **Vary sizes** - Use range (minSize to maxSize) for variety  
✅ **Consider gameplay** - Room size affects combat, visibility  

### Room Count
✅ **Start conservative** - Too many rooms = no corridors  
✅ **Test and adjust** - Find sweet spot for your maze size  
✅ **Scale with size** - Larger mazes support more rooms  
✅ **Leave buffer** - Algorithm needs space to place rooms  

### Algorithm Selection
✅ **Recursive Backtracker** - Long corridors between rooms  
✅ **Recursive Division** - Natural chamber feeling  
✅ **Eller** - Fast generation for large dungeons  
✅ **Prim** - Lots of branching paths  

### Reproducibility
✅ **Use seeds** - For save/load or multiplayer sync  
✅ **Document seed** - Let players share dungeon layouts  
✅ **Seed variation** - Combine base seed with level number

## Performance

### Time Complexity
- Room placement: O(roomCount × attempts)
- Room carving: O(roomArea)
- Total: O(roomCount × maxRoomSize²)

### Typical Performance
- 30×30 maze, 5 rooms: < 2ms
- 50×50 maze, 10 rooms: < 5ms
- 100×100 maze, 15 rooms: < 15ms

### Optimization Tips
- Reduce roomCount for faster generation
- Smaller max room size = faster
- Larger mazes have more placement options

---

## Troubleshooting

### Too Few Rooms Placed
**Problem:** Requested 10 rooms, only got 5

**Solutions:**
- Increase maze size (more space)
- Reduce min/max room sizes (smaller rooms)
- Reduce room count request
- Check room sizes aren't too large for maze

### Rooms Not Connected
**Problem:** Isolated room areas

**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen (modifier ensures connection)
- If it does, report as bug

### Poor Room Distribution
**Problem:** All rooms in one area

**Solution:**
- Use different random seed
- Increase maze size
- Adjust room size parameters

        };
        
        return new Maze(config);
    }
    
    private int GetTimestampSeed()
    {
        return (int)(DateTime.Now.Ticks & 0xFFFFFFFF);
    }
}
```

### Themed Dungeons
```csharp

{
    Crypt, Cave, Castle, Mine
}

public Maze GenerateThemedDungeon(DungeonTheme theme)
{
    return theme switch
    {
        DungeonTheme.Crypt => MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
            30, 30, roomCount: 6, minRoomSize: 3, maxRoomSize: 5),
        
        DungeonTheme.Cave => MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
            35, 35, roomCount: 4, minRoomSize: 5, maxRoomSize: 10),
        
        DungeonTheme.Castle => MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
            40, 40, roomCount: 8, minRoomSize: 4, maxRoomSize: 8),
        
        DungeonTheme.Mine => MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(
            25, 25, roomCount: 3, minRoomSize: 3, maxRoomSize: 6),
        
        _ => MazeFactory.CreateWithRooms(30, 30)
    };
}
```
